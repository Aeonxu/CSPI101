          I really love playing video games and watching movies. I like getting
          lost in exciting stories and tough challenges. When Iâ€™m not playing
          games, I enjoy daydreaming and listening to music.

          <span class="purple">Purple</span> is my absolute favorite color, and
          I love incorporating it into everything I do.

          My goal is to become a successful Frontend Developer, and I believe
          that consistent effort and a structured plan are key to achieving that
          goal. As the famous quote goes, "If the plan doesn't work, change the
          plan but never the goal" (Daniel Hurst).
